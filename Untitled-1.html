<h2><p> I want to become a software engineer. I started learning 
    computer from age 5. My dad taught basic computer 
    knowledge. To achieve my goal, I need to learn programming 
    languages. I attended a free trial class in (Whitehat Jr) but I 
    didn’t feel like joining the programming language because of 
    the platform they are using.</p> </h2>
<h2><p>Presently, I am learning Python language. My dad’s colleague 
    started teaching me python at first. After some days I created 
    a small programme. It even helped in maths like calculating 
    big numbers and BOADMAS. I spend a lot of time on 
    computers to achieve goals.</p> </h2>
        <h2><p>My inspiration is Bill Gates co-founder of Microsoft and 
            Tanmay Bakshi, youngest programmer, author and employee 
            at Google.</p></h2>
        <h2><p>My dream is creating an OS like Windows and Mac.</p></h2>
        <h2><p>I realized that I am very interested in computers. During 
            covid-19 pandemic lockdown holidays, I started exploring 
            windows 10. My uncle teaches me some computer knowledge 
            like activating Windows and Microsoft Office with the 
            product key.</p></h2>
            <h2><p>Finally, I upgraded my laptop from Windows 10 to windows 
                11 on my own. I am exploring more in windows 11. My 
                parents and my uncle support me in doing all these activities.</p></h2>
